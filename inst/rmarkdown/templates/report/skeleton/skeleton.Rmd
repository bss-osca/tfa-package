## Colophon 
<!-- Always keep this section -->

This report has been created inside [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and the [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) format. 

The report was built using:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
session <- devtools::session_info()
session$platform
```

Along with these packages:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
session$packages %>% 
  select(package, loadedversion, date, source) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE,
                class = 'cell-border stripe',
                filter = list(position = 'top'),
                options = list(pageLength = 5, 
                           autoWidth = FALSE,
                           bInfo = FALSE,
                           paging = TRUE))
```
